# My Changes

The new code has been modified to scrape the most read headline from The Daily Pennsylvanian's "Opinion" sub-page instead of the main headline from the home page. Here are the key changes:

## 1. URL Change

- The URL has been changed to `"https://www.thedp.com/section/opinion"` to target the "Opinion" sub-page.

## 2. Target Element Selector

- Instead of directly looking for an anchor (`<a>`) tag with a specific class, the new code searches for all `<h3>` elements with the class `"standard-link"`, assuming that the most read headlines on the "Opinion" sub-page are likely wrapped in these elements.

## 3. Iterating Over Multiple Elements

- The new code iterates over the list of `<h3>` elements obtained from `soup.find_all()`. For each `<h3>` element, it looks for an anchor (`<a>`) tag within that element using `h3.find('a')`.
- If an anchor tag is found, it assumes that the text content of that anchor tag is the desired headline and assigns it to the `data_point` variable.
- The `break` statement ensures that the loop stops after finding the first matching element, assuming that only the most read headline is required.

The rationale behind these changes is to adapt the code to scrape the specific content and structure of the "Opinion" sub-page, as the layout and HTML structure of the sub-page is different from the home page.

By iterating over the `<h3>` elements with the class `"standard-link"`, the new code attempts to find the most read headline, which is wrapped in an anchor (`<a>`) tag within the first `<h3>` elements.

## Overview

The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/scrape.yaml` runs on a defined schedule to:

1. Checkout the code
2. Set up the Python environment
3. Install dependencies via Pipenv
4. Run the python script `script.py` to scrape data
5. Commit any updated data files to the Git repository

## Scheduling

The workflow schedule is configured with [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run:

- Every day at 8PM UTC

This once-daily scraping is a good rule-of-thumb, as it is generally respectful of the target website, as it does not contribute to any measurable burden to the site's resources.

You can use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to generate your own cron schedule.

## Python Libraries

The main libraries used are:

- [`bs4`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
- [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Making HTTP requests to scrape web pages
- [`loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) - Logging errors and run info
- [`pytz`](https://github.com/stub42/pytz) - Handling datetimes and timezones  
- [`waybackpy`](https://github.com/akamhy/waybackpy/) - Scraping web archives (optional)

## Getting Started

To adapt this for your own scraping project:

- Use [this template to create your own repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
- Modify `script.py` to scrape different sites and data points:
  - Modifying the request URL
  - Parsing the HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract relevant data
  - Processing and outputting the scraped data as CSV, JSON etc
- Update the workflow schedule as needed
- Output and commit the scraped data to CSV, JSON or other formats
- Add any additional libraries to `Pipfile` that you need
- Update this `README.md` with project specifics

Feel free to use this as a starter kit for your Python web scraping projects!

## Setting Up a Local Development

It is recommended to use a version manager, and virtual environments and environment managers for local development of Python projects.

**asdf** is a version manager that allows you to easily install and manage multiple versions of languages and runtimes like Python. This is useful so you can upgrade/downgrade Python versions without interfering with your system Python.

**Pipenv** creates a **virtual environment** for your project to isolate its dependencies from other projects. This allows you to install packages safely without impacting globally installed packages that other tools or apps may rely on. The virtual env also allows reproducibility of builds across different systems.

Below we detail how to setup these environments to develop this template scrape project locally.

### Setting Up a Python Environment

Once you have installed `asdf`, you can install the Python plugin with:

```bash
asdf plugin add python
```

Then you can install the latest version of Python with:

```bash
asdf install python latest
```

After that, you can first install `pipenv` with:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

### Installing Project Dependencies

Then you can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

This will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the `Pipfile`. The `--dev` flag will also install the development dependencies, which includes `ipykernel` for Jupyter Notebook support.

### Running the Script

You can then run the script to try it out with:

```bash
pipenv run python script.py
```

## Some Ethical Guidelines to Consider

Web scraping is a powerful tool for gathering data, and its [legality has been upheld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn).

But it is important to use it responsibly and ethically. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. Review the website's Terms of Service and [`robots.txt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robots.txt) file to understand allowances and restrictions for automated scraping before starting.

2. Avoid scraping copyrighted content verbatim without permission. Summarizing is safer. Use data judiciously under "fair use" principles.

3. Do not enable illegal or fraudulent uses of scraped data, and be mindful of security and privacy.

4. Check that your scraping activity does not overload or harm the website's servers. Scale activity gradually.

5. Reflect on whether scraping could unintentionally reveal private user or organizational information from the site.

6. Consider if scraped data could negatively impact the website's value or business model.

7. Assess if decisions made using the data could contribute to bias, discrimination or unfair profiling.

8. Validate quality of scraped data, and recognize limitations in ensuring relevance and accuracy inherent with web data.  

9. Document your scraping process thoroughly for replicability, transparency and accountability.

10. Continuously re-evaluate your scraping program against applicable laws and ethical principles.
